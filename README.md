# Hardhat Project for Elections

I created this project basically to learn hardhat framework. This project has a single contract to conduct transparent 
elections, where the results can be computed from events.

Some of the hardhat tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

Refer [hardhat docs](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/config) for setting up configuration to deploy.
